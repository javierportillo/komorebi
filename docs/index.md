_komorebi_ is a tiling window manager that works as an extension to
Microsoft's [Desktop Window Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dwm/dwm-overview) in Windows 10 and
above.

_komorebi_ allows you to control application windows, virtual workspaces and display monitors with a CLI which can be
used with third-party software such as [AutoHotKey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) to set user-defined
keyboard shortcuts.

_komorebi_ aims to make _as few modifications as possible_ to the operating system and desktop environment by default.
Users are free to make such modifications in their own configuration files for _komorebi_, but these will remain
opt-in and off-by-default for the foreseeable future.
